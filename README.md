This is a very simple program using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.5, typescript and google maps. It demonstrates how to use components, directives and services with a simple folder structure. It also demonstrates a color randomizer directive.     

## Setup 
Navigate into the root folder of the project and run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.

## Edit
Navigate to pubilc/src/app/app.module.ts and insert your google maps api key.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
